### I AM UPDATING ON MY OWN BUT WILL STOP TO POST IT ###

BOT using IB_INSYNC Library. Thank you Ewald!

strategy & indicat files most be setup by the user. There is some stuff there but just as sample of it.

The plan can be also setup easy with a dictionary as:

plan = {
    'EUR_USD_0': {
        atr = 0.00750
        break_lunch = [1100, 1500]
        trading_hours = [900, 1800]
        profit = [5, 30, 100, 'day']
        stop = [1.5, 30, 100, 'day']
        duration = pd.to_datetime(30, unit='m').time()
        try_qty = 3
        direction = 'sell'
        strat = {'strat5': 3}
        strat_cond = 'and'
        strat_name = 'trade_short'
        size = 100
    }
}
